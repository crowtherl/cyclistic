# cyclistic
In this repository, I analyze bike-share data for the fictional company Cyclistic to determine differences between riders with an annual membership (“members”) and riders who purchase single-use or day passes (“casual riders”), with the aim of discovering insights that can help Cyclistic convert casual riders into members.

My summary report can be viewed at [this page](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/crowtherln/cyclistic/blob/main/casual-riders-vs-members_summary.html 'How Do Casual Cyclistic Riders Differ from Members? | Summary'), a rendering of [_casual-riders-vs-members_summary.html_](https://github.com/crowtherln/cyclistic/blob/main/casual-riders-vs-members_summary.html 'casual-riders-vs-members_summary.Rmd at main • crowtherln/cyclistic'). The report introduces the project, visualizes the data, and presents observations and recommendations based on the data. It was produced by running [_casual-riders-vs-members_summary.Rmd_](https://github.com/crowtherln/cyclistic/blob/main/casual-riders-vs-members_summary.Rmd 'casual-riders-vs-members_summary.Rmd at main • crowtherln/cyclistic').

### Credits

I adapted the R scripts from [this one](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TTj5KNKf4BWvEORGm10oNbpwTRk1hamsWJGj6qRWpuI/edit 'Divvy Exercise R Script - Google Docs'), which in turn is based on "['Sophisticated, Clear, and Polished': Divvy and Data Visualization](https://artscience.blog/home/divvy-dataviz-case-study '\'Sophisticated, Clear, and Polished\': Divvy and Data Visualization (Case Study) — ART+SCIENCE')," written by Kevin Hartman.

The task was provided by Google as part of the Coursera course "[Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone 'Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study | Coursera')," part of the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics 'Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate | Coursera').

The [data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html 'Index of bucket \"divvy-tripdata\"') was provided by [Divvy](https://ride.divvybikes.com/ 'Divvy: Chicago\'s Bike share Program | Divvy Bikes'), a real-world bike share system in the Chicago area that is owned by the [Chicago Department of Transportation](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdot.html 'City of Chicago :: Transportation') (CDOT) and managed by [Lyft, Inc.](https://www.lyft.com/ 'Lyft: A ride whenever you need one'), and made available under [this license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement 'Data License Agreement | Divvy Bikes').

### Other Files

Before switching to R Markdown, I initially used a simple R script, [_cyclistic.R_](https://github.com/crowtherln/cyclistic/blob/main/other/cyclistic.R 'cyclistic/cyclistic.R at main • crowtherln/cyclistic'). This script produced 10 dataframes summarizing the data. These dataframes were exported to CSV files, which have been uploaded to the [_r-output_ folder](https://github.com/crowtherln/cyclistic/tree/main/other/r-output 'cyclistic/other/r-output at main • crowtherln/cyclistic'). I combined the CSV files into an Excel workbook, where I did further analysis and visualization, and created a [PowerPoint presentation](https://github.com/crowtherln/cyclistic/blob/main/other/casual-riders-vs-members.pptx 'cyclistic/casual-riders-vs-members.pptx at main • crowtherln/cyclistic') summarizing key findings. I created the R Markdown files afterward to combine the entire process into a single program.
