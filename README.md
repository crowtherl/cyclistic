# cyclistic
Analyzes bike-share data for the fictional company Cyclistic to determine differences between riders with an annual membership (“members”) and riders who purchase single-use or day passes (“casual riders”).

_cyclistic.R_ is the script I used to clean and analyze the data. I adapted it from [this script](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TTj5KNKf4BWvEORGm10oNbpwTRk1hamsWJGj6qRWpuI/edit 'Divvy Exercise R Script - Google Docs'), which in turn is based on "['Sophisticated, Clear, and Polished': Divvy and Data Visualization](https://artscience.blog/home/divvy-dataviz-case-study '\'Sophisticated, Clear, and Polished\': Divvy and Data Visualization (Case Study) — ART+SCIENCE')," written by Kevin Hartman. The script produces 10 data frames summarizing the data by ride counts, ride length, days of the week, months, and ride locations. These data frames were exported as CSV files, which have been uploaded to the _r-output_ folder.

I combined the CSV files into an Excel workbook, where I did further analysis and visualization.

_casual-riders-vs-members.pptx_ summarizes key findings on the differences between members and casual riders.
