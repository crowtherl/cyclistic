# cyclistic
Analyzes bike-share data for the fictional company Cyclistic to determine differences between riders with an annual membership (“members”) and riders who purchase single-use or day passes (“casual riders”).

_cyclistic.R_ is the script I used to clean and analyze the data. I adapted it from [this script](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TTj5KNKf4BWvEORGm10oNbpwTRk1hamsWJGj6qRWpuI/edit 'Divvy Exercise R Script - Google Docs'), which in turn is based on "['Sophisticated, Clear, and Polished': Divvy and Data Visualization](https://artscience.blog/home/divvy-dataviz-case-study '\'Sophisticated, Clear, and Polished\': Divvy and Data Visualization (Case Study) — ART+SCIENCE')," written by Kevin Hartman. The script produces 10 data frames summarizing the data by ride counts, ride length, days of the week, months, and ride locations. These data frames were exported as CSV files, which have been uploaded to the _r-output_ folder.

This project was conducted for the Coursera course “[Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone 'Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study | Coursera'),” which is part of the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics 'Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate | Coursera'). The task was provided by Google. The data was provided by [Divvy](https://ride.divvybikes.com/ 'Divvy: Chicago\'s Bike share Program | Divvy Bikes'), a real-world bike share system in the Chicago area that is owned by the [Chicago Department of Transportation](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdot.html 'City of Chicago :: Transportation') (CDOT) and managed by [Lyft, Inc.](https://www.lyft.com/ 'Lyft: A ride whenever you need one') The data was made available under [this license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement 'Data License Agreement | Divvy Bikes').
